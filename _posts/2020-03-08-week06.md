title: Week 6, some evaluations   
---

The invited talk was interesting. I enjoyed having her come and speak for a full 75 minutes rather than split time like she did last time. It felt like more topics could be covered and was very fun to hear more from her. 

Doing the project evaluations was also extremely fun and interesting. I felt like I learned a lot more about what goes into these projects and the different types of open source projects that can exist. There's clearly an extremely wide range of types of projects from documentation, to level of activity, to development environment. Finding out some of that information for different projects was a little tough but still extremely interesting to read about. 

Seeing how different projects tagged / flagged different issues was the most interesting thing to me. 

I don't think I'm in a place to pick a project 100% yet but I definitely feel like I'm getting there and by the end of the week / definitely the next two weeks I think I'll have a really good idea of one or two things I want to work on the rest of the semester.
