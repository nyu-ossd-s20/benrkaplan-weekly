title: Week 11, stuff 
---

This week was just a slow week in general due to the weather and being stuck inside. We made some progress as a group adding documentation and working together on a solution to fix one of the issues. It was a little tough to work together due to technical issues as not all of us had stable internet. 

Overall I feel like we're making solid progress and definitely learning alot about working in a group as well as getting work done effectively and remotely. 

The class discussions this week were cool to listen to regarding open source COVID-19 projects. I enjoyed the topic even though it feels like thats all that is being talked about right now.
