title: Week 10, stand ups

I found it very interesting to hear about how far other groups were. It was nice that a lot of them were screenshares so we could all really see what they had done and in hindsight, we should have done that too when we started. The group working on the covid-19 project was interesting due to how topical that is right now. 

It's been very interesting getting familiar with a larger code base and definitely a bit tougher when not in a work environment. It has also been cool to communicate with a community who has been working on this project for so long. 

I have not contributed to Wikipedia in ages but I do use the platform on an almost daily basis and think it is a great source of information. I use it for personal, educational, and research purposes and I think it is valuable to all three.
