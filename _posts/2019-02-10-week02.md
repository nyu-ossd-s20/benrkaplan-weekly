title: Week 2, web extensions
---


This week we spent the majority of the time going over the example web extensions while brainstorming for topics for our web extension. So far I have created the repository and done a little bit of research into licensing types we should use for our extension. As of right now we have not made a large amount of progress but have familiarized ourselves with the necessary aspects of making an extension. We did so by doing the tutorials and reading into the information provided by Mozilla. I think we will have a working product by the due date. So far working on this project I have learned more JSON than I have ever had to use as well as learning what goes into creating a browser extention. I was not familiar with these concepts. The other things we did I was familiar with.
