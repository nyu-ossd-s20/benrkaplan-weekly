title: Week 3, web extensions wrapped up 
---

Working on the browser extension with my group was very interesting. It was an odd experience working with people who have differing levels of experience using different things such as git and JS. I enjoyed being able to work with others and collaborate towards a semi-finished project that does what we're looking for it to do. This was not my first experience working this way but it was in a class setting. 

The only real new skill I feel I learned here was the process and structure of a browser extension which seems very valluable and I think I will definitely use that knowledge in the future. I couldn't really figure out what my preferences were regarding working in a group because of the differing skill levels we all had to work together to get it done and got the majority of the work done together in person. 

I really enjoyed all of the presentations and especially the word to pet and table of contents as that seemed like something I would actually use.
