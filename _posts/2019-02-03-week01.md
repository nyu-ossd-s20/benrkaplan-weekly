When I hear open source I think of free, and available to annyone. I think about everyone having access to something as a resource and as something that can be improved upon. This is a great idea but unmodderated can obviously go poorly. I'm hoping to get a better understanding of the open source process in this class so in the future I can contribute. 

My four favorite open source projects in no particular order would have to be Wikipedia, uBlock, tabio, and FileZilla. Also that totally is in order so the last thing I said is a lie. I use Wikipedia, uBlock, and tabio on a daily basis and living without them would be tough. The only one of those three that I have contributed to is Wikipedia. liar with these concepts. The other things we did I was familiar with.
