title: Week 5, looking at projects   
---

After evaluating projects in class it became very clear that there are some extremely established open source projects that we can contribute to. I was obviously aware that there are many established open source projects but the ones we looked at were things I had never heard of and were super serious. They provided extensice information on their websites and that was very helpful. 

From community standards to how to contribute to how tutorials on using the software, everything my group looked at was clear and easily accessible. They had a great channel for reporting and solving bugs and very detailed documentation in their repositories. I had never looked at a gitlab repository but that was still easy to navigate and had essentially the same layout as github from the language breakdown to how to clone / fork the repo. 

I do not think that after this week I am ready to pick a project to contribute to. I think that is going to take more time. 

I was sick an unable to make it to the invited speakers talk and am quite disapointed. Reading through his linkedin, github, and the github repos on the bloomberg website was very interesting. 

I have not contributed to any open source projects this week, my only github contributions were to personal projects.
