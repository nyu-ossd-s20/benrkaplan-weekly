title: Week 4, guest speakers 
---

I found this weeks speakers to be extremely interesting. In particular, Deena Engel's portion of her presentation on cleaning data and handling incomplete data was cool to hear about. I liked how she talked about how different fields would deal with different types of incomplete data such as an anthropologist vs a scientist. It was also nice to hear about all the different open source / open data resources that are available to us to both use and contribute to. I've spent a lot more time than I've wanted to working with databases outside of school so I wasn't super stoked to hear about any more SQL in a presentation from a speaker so that was definitely a major downside.
