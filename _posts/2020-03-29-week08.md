title: Week 8, online learning and group projects   
---

We haven't made a superb amount of progress on the gorup project but we have reached out and been in contact with the owners of the project. We discussed what we can do to contribute and where we will be starting. 

Utilizing zoom to do group meetings has been weird to adjust to but I'm sure all of us in the group will become more accustomed to meeting this way, rather than in person for the rest of the semester. It will definitely take time to adjust to that. 

Personally, its been interesting being in contact so far and I think over the next week or two our involvement will increase and we will be able to begin contributing which will be more interesting. I'm not sure I'll get over the online meetings / working from home but there isn't much of a choice there.
